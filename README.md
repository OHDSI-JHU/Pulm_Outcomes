**Description** </n>

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains one of the most common pulmonary conditions in adults worldwide, representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The disease is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, often requiring substantial healthcare resources. Despite advancements in chronic management, acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) frequently necessitate emergency department (ED) visits and subsequent hospitalization. These acute episodes are critical events in the disease trajectory, often leading to high-cost and invasive interventions, including the need for mechanical ventilation. Understanding the landscape of disease treatment is a crucial first step toward developing effective interventions.  This study aims to bridge that gap by characterizing the clinical outcomes and treatment patterns, specifically the use of bronchodilators, systemic steroids, and oxygen, among adults aged 40 years or older presenting to the ED with COPD. This protocol utilizes a unique international comparison between Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States and Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, providing a broader perspective on the management of this high-burden condition.

### Challenges:
  
* The inclusion criteria include ED visit, which is very compute intensive when calculating patient count across network.
*  
* 
* 
* 

### Next steps:

1. Review concept IDs corresponding counts to finaliza cohort definition.
3. Use the finalized inclusion and exclusion criteria to recruit network partners.
4. Work on finetuning cohort definition with data partners.
5. Identify concept IDs for outcome and predictors with data partners.
6. Conduct a clinical characterization analysis at Hopkins.
7. Perform the Network with clinical characterization code developed at Hopkins.
